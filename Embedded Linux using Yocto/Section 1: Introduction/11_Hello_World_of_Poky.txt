Workflow of Yocto Project
----------------------------
Step 1: Download the Poky Source code
  $ git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
Step 2: Checkout the latest branch/release 
  $ git checkout zeus
Step 3: Prepare the build environment.
  Poky provides you a script `oe-init-build-env`, which should be used to set up the build environment.
  Script will set up your environment to use Yocto build system, including adding the Bitbake utility to your path
  $ source poky/oe-init-build-env [build_directory]

  Here, build_directory is an optional argument for the name of the directory where the environment is set if it is not given, it defaults to "build"

  The above script will direct you to a build folder and create two files (local.conf, bblayers.conf) inside the conf folder.

Step 4: Building a Linux Distribution.
  $ bitbake <image_name>
  $ time bitbake core-image-minimal
