OpenEmbedded Project
-----------------------------------------
From http://www.openembedded.org/wiki/Main_Page

OpenEmbedded offers a best-in-class cross-compile environment. It allows developers to create a complete Linux Distribution for embedded systems.

What is the different between OpenEmbedded and the Yocto Project.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded share a core collection of metadata called openembedded-core.
However, the two organizations remain separate, each with its own focus.

OpenEmbedded provides a comprehensive set of metadatas for a wide variety of architectures, features, and applications
	Not a reference distribution
	Designed to be the foundation for others

The Yocto Project focuses on providing powerful, easy-to-use, interoperable, well-tested tools, metadata, and board support packages (BSPs) for a core set of architectures and specific boards.
